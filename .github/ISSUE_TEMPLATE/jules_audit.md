# 🚨 JULES AUTOMATED AUDIT REPORT

**Title:** `[JULES-ESCALATION] {Type}: {Concise Description of the Issue}`
**Priority:** `{Critical | High | Medium}`
**Category:** `{Security | Architecture | Tech Debt | UI/UX}`

---

## 📍 Context & Location

- **File:** `{src/path/to/file.ts}`
- **Line(s):** `{L45-L55}`
- **Component/Function:** `{ComponentName}`

## ⚠️ The Problem

> _Detailed explanation of the issue found._
> _(Example: "I detected a complex nested ternary operator inside the render method that reduces readability, coupled with a raw SQL query in the API route that lacks input sanitization.")_

## 🛑 Reason for Escalation (Why I didn't fix it)

- [ ] **Risk:** Fixing this might break dependent modules.
- [ ] **Ambiguity:** Multiple valid solutions exist; human decision required.
- [ ] **Scope:** Requires creating new files or architectural changes.
- [ ] **Security:** Potential false positive or requires sensitive access.

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution (AI Recommendation)

I recommend the following strategy for the human developer:

1.  **Refactor:** Extract the logic at lines X-Y into a custom hook named `useLogic`.
2.  **Pattern:** Apply the `{Strategy Name}` pattern.
3.  **Security:** Wrap the input in `zod` schema validation before passing to the DB.
